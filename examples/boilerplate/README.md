# Boilerplate example

`src/lib.rs` is tiny, it defines a struct to implement Solutions for.

`src/main.rs` contains code that lets you run your solutions from the command line, see also the [cli](../cli) example.

Solutions are implemented in a module for each day, `day1.rs` shows the required setup.
