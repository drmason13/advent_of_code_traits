## Looking for ideas how to contribute?

Browse through the issues marked [`help-wanted`]() and if something speaks to you, comment on the issue to let me (and anyone else wanting to contribute) know.

I think it would be cool for people to collaborate with me and each other on issues, especially things that are more design/architecture orientated.

If you're struggling with an issue that you've claimed, don't worry about it.

You can comment to say something like
> "hmm, this is harder than I thought. If someone else wants to take a shot, be my guest"

Or ask a question and hopefully someone will have an idea that helps.
